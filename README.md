# PokeShowdownAI

A semi-intelligent AI, that uses specified rules in order to battle on Pokemon Showdown Generation 8 Random Battles.
There is a lot to be improved upon, such as expanding on the rules for specific situations in order to model intelligent decision making in Pokemon battles.

More possible future work would include implemented using the poke-env framework in order to utilise Reinforcement Learning to train the bot.
This was attempted using the provided Gen8EnvSinglePlayer class provided by poke-env, but there were issues in implementing this towards a live environment.
